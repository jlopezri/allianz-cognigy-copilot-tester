Thanks, I updated it. You wanted to raise a claim right? Could you explain me what happened in details?
00:00:33 Speaker 2
So, it looks my neighbour was doing reforms at his house and somehow broked my pipe. My washroom is full of water.
00:00:34 Speaker 1
ok, I understand, so are you in danger? You need first to call emergency? Or you want to continue cresting the claim?
00:00:36 Speaker 2
Is fine I prefer to do it all now, I already called the technic through another Allianz service. They helped me but told I need to raise a claim to you, so calling again.
