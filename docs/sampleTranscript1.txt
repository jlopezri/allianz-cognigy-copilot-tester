Thank you very much. What happened at your house was a breakdown, an accident involving what in front of what?
00:01:42 Speaker 2
Only water got into the house, one.
00:01:47 Speaker 2
How can I explain your roof to you?
00:01:50 Speaker 1
Okay, but do you have any building insurance with us because I only see some contents insurance?
00:02:03 Speaker 2
I think so, I have it with my bank.
00:02:06 Speaker 1
With the bank, what is the policy number you have with you?
00:02:10 Speaker 2
No.
00:02:13 Speaker 1
Let me check here if you could wait a moment, please, if possible.
00:02:17 Speaker 2
I considered my husband's name, please.
00:02:20 Speaker 1
Yes, what would be your husband's taxpayer number?
00:02:23 Speaker 2
Can you wait a moment, please? I have to look it up, I can't remember.
00:02:29 Speaker 1
No problem.
00:02:56 Speaker 2
Oh, really?
00:02:59 Speaker 1
I have the Apollo number or BPI Bank certificate, Ms. Andreia Souza, because...
00:03:07 Speaker 2
I am at my workplace.
00:03:09 Speaker 1
Right, but the insurance is linked to the mortgage with us, is that right?
00:03:15 Speaker 2
Yes.
00:03:17 Speaker 1
And it's a leak coming from the roof.
00:03:21 Speaker 2
Yes.
00:03:22 Speaker 1
And do you live in an apartment or a house?
00:03:25 Speaker 2
For sale.
00:03:26 Speaker 1
A sale, very well, then I will check here and go through the procedure. So, if you could wait a moment, please, that would be possible.
00:03:33 Speaker 2
Yes, yes.
00:03:34 Speaker 1
Thank you very much.
00:05:26 Speaker 1
Mr. Andreia Sousa, yes, thank you very much for waiting, and I was here confirming on your behalf. We don't have any building insurance, it may be in your husband's name and he was the first policyholder. However, if it's the company's insurance, I can indicate that now.
00:05:45 Speaker 1
The procedures Ah, since it's a leak, what we recommend in order to speed up the process is that you call someone to identify the source of the problem. Whether it's a crack in the tiles, maintenance, or even a break.
00:06:05 Speaker 1
It's a pipe.
00:06:07 Speaker 2
I already did that, you already took care of it yesterday, it was a problem with the roof sheet metal.
00:06:15 Speaker 1
Right.
00:06:16 Speaker 2
I needed to report it to the insurance company. It was the damage it did inside.
00:06:23 Speaker 1
Inside the house, that is, when you say damage inside, what was damaged?
00:06:30 Speaker 2
It damaged the wood around the glass wall, and that was it, it was wood, EE. The wall was wood, wasn't it?
00:06:43 Speaker 1
Right, the building insurance policy also has to be activated, because that's what covers the structure of the house. What we need to be presented with is a repair estimate, along with photos of the damage.
00:07:00 Speaker 1
And a report indicating the source of the problem.
00:07:06 Speaker 2
OK, that report can be requested, for example, from the gentleman who came yesterday.
00:07:11 Speaker 1
A.
00:07:12 Speaker 2
Chapa or a?
00:07:13 Speaker 1
Yes.
00:07:14 Speaker 2
How am I going to get out of this report?
00:07:16 Speaker 1
It could be the gentleman who went to your house yesterday to do the repair. He can issue that report indicating the source of the damage.
00:07:28 Speaker 2
Yes, yes, yes, when?
00:07:32 Speaker 1
I mean, the report is a document written by him indicating the cause of the problem with the metal sheets.
00:07:43 Speaker 2
So could you repeat that, please, it's a report.
00:07:46 Speaker 1
Budget.
00:07:48 Speaker 2
Budget report.
00:07:51 Speaker 1
And photos.
00:07:53 Speaker 2
And photos, yes, but now what?
00:08:01 Speaker 2
Well, for example, you have to come back later, I'll send THIS to where? To an email address.
00:08:07 Speaker 1
To our sinister email.
00:08:12 Speaker 2
Yes, sinister.
00:08:13 Speaker 1
It's sinister in the singular.
00:08:16 Speaker 2
Sinister.
00:08:17 Speaker 1

Point PT.
00:08:35 Speaker 1
And you have to put your husband's taxpayer number or policy number in the subject line.
00:08:54 Speaker 2
Would you mind waiting just a moment while I confirm something here?
00:08:59 Speaker 1
Yes.
00:09:14 Speaker 2
Oh, really?
00:10:10 Speaker 2
Look, I can give you my husband's tax ID number so you can check.
00:10:15 Speaker 1
Can I have your husband's taxpayer ID number, please?
00:10:18 Speaker 2

00:11:03 Speaker 1
Yes, since the insurance policy is actually in your husband's name and you are listed as the second holder? Yes.
00:11:13 Speaker 2
Yes.
00:11:15 Speaker 1
Then I can provide the policy number here, if you wish.

00:11:22 Speaker 1
I have it written down.
00:11:24 Speaker 2

00:12:11 Speaker 2
Okay.
00:12:12 Speaker 1
