Good afternoon, welcome to Allianz Portugal. My name is Isabela Franco. How may I help you?
00:00:06 Speaker 2
Good afternoon, Isabela. Here's the thing: I filed a claim, but I changed my policy.
00:00:16 Speaker 2
And in the meantime, I asked for this report to be forwarded to the correct policy, but I haven't had any feedback and I wanted to know what the status of this report is.
00:00:32 Speaker 1
Of course it was.
00:00:34 Speaker 2
Through BPI. I don't know if it makes any difference, no.
00:00:38 Speaker 1
Yes.
00:00:39 Speaker 2
I know there's a specific protocol?
00:00:42 Speaker 1
Yes, first of all, I'm talking to.
00:00:44 Speaker 2
Nelson Lourenço.
00:00:46 Speaker 1
Thank you, Mr Nelson Lourenço, what is your contribution, please?
00:00:51 Speaker 2
20, 8052-3132.
00:00:57 Speaker 1
13 Thank you, leave me here, then, at the Fair.
00:01:08 Speaker 1
It's 208.
00:01:10 Speaker 2
052313.
00:01:18 Speaker 1
I'll place the order, but please confirm your full name and date of birth.
00:01:22 Speaker 2
Nelson, Manoel Coutinho, Alexandre Lourenço, 8/03/1975.
00:01:29 Speaker 1
Thank you. What policy did you ask the bank to take out? Please submit your application, Mr Nelson.
00:01:36 Speaker 2
So, on the bank's application form, I indicated that I wanted a policy for a given address.
00:01:44 Speaker 2
On Rua 31 de Janeiro. But then I was notified by you that the policy was for contents and not for multi-risk, so I asked for it to be changed to multi-risk, but I didn't receive any information and that was it.
00:02:04 Speaker 2
Please, how was the situation?
00:02:09 Speaker 1
Right, you sent us that reply email on the 14th, and then today, exactly, there was no reply. I'll go now.
00:02:24 Speaker 1
Proceed with opening the case. Could you just explain to me what happened, please?
00:02:31 Speaker 2
Yes, I know here when it's no longer, what's the name of the storm that came at the end of October?
00:02:42 Speaker 2
And then some stains appeared on the ceiling of the house. I think there must be some kind of leak or something like that.
00:02:50 Speaker 1
Let me just take a look.
00:02:52 Speaker 2
I think I even attached some photos. I'm not sure.
00:02:56 Speaker 1
Thank you very much, let me just find out why.
00:03:00 Speaker 1
The policy is difficult, I can't find it. It's linked to the mortgage.
00:03:06 Speaker 2
Yes, yes, it is.
00:03:07 Speaker 1
Actually, there is another policyholder, sir.
00:03:13 Speaker 2
Nelson.
00:03:14 Speaker 1
Clara, and it's on 31 January Street, correct?
00:03:21 Speaker 2
Yes.
00:03:22 Speaker 1
The mortgage insurance was in her name. Did you say as the second holder?
00:03:27 Speaker 2
I did.
00:03:29 Speaker 1
Yes, yes, yes, it was in her name and you are the second holder, but I, since you also find that we don't find it.
00:03:38 Speaker 2
A.
00:03:40 Speaker 2
Give her the information if necessary.
00:03:43 Speaker 1
No, that won't be necessary, thank you. As you are the second holder, we can proceed with the calls without any problem. So it was an infiltration, correct?
00:03:52 Speaker 2
Yes.
00:03:53 Speaker 1
Yes, and what about this situation?
00:03:55 Speaker 1
When did it start, when did you notice it, Mr Nelson Lourenço?
00:03:59 Speaker 2
When that time after the storm, I remember the name of it now, it was at the end of September.
00:04:12 Speaker 1
Very well, and have you called someone to the site to assess the damage?
00:04:17 Speaker 2
No, because I was usually waiting for you to contact me, because normally, at least once, since I had already participated in something like this.
00:04:31 Speaker 2
It's if you take care of it, I wanted to take care of it, so the whole process is like that. I spoke informally with an acquaintance, but he said that as a consul, normally THIS is what José basically likes.
00:04:49 Speaker 1
Yes, we did send someone to the location to check on the situation, but if our clients want to call someone privately, we also give them that opportunity. That's why I asked, Mr Nelson Lourenço.
00:05:03 Speaker 2
Yes, yes, yes, I understand.
00:05:06 Speaker 2
I prefer, I prefer that you follow up because sometimes, for some reason, people may not have the expected skills, and so I know that if it comes through the insurance company, they have the competence to solve the problems.
00:05:25 Speaker 1
Of course, I will then proceed to open the case and request our expert. If you could wait a moment, please, that would be possible, Mr Nelson Lourenço, thank you.
00:08:16 Speaker 1
Mr Nelson Lourenço, thank you for waiting. I have now opened the case. Could you please give me the claim number?
00:08:28 Speaker 2
Just a moment, just a moment.
00:08:56 Speaker 2
OK, can you tell me now?
00:08:58 Speaker 1

00:09:28 Speaker 1
